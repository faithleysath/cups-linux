container

container is a tool that you can use to create and run Linux containers as lightweight virtual machines on your Mac. It's written in Swift, and optimized for Apple silicon.

The tool consumes and produces OCI-compatible container images, so you can pull and run images from any standard container registry. You can push images that you build to those registries as well, and run the images in any other OCI-compatible application.

container uses the Containerization Swift package for low level container, image, and process management.

Get started

Requirements

You need a Mac with Apple silicon to run container. To build it, see the BUILDING document.

container is supported on macOS 26, since it takes advantage of new features and enhancements to virtualization and networking in this release. We do not support older versions of macOS and the container maintainers typically will not address issues that cannot be reproduced on the latest macOS 26 beta.

Install or upgrade

If you're upgrading, first uninstall your existing container while preserving your user data:

uninstall-container.sh -k
Download the latest signed installer package for container from the GitHub release page.

To install the tool, double-click the package file and follow the instructions. Enter your administrator password when prompted, to give the installer permission to place the installed files under /usr/local.

Start the system service with:

container system start
Uninstall

Use the uninstall-container.sh script to remove container from your system. To remove your user data along with the tool, run:

uninstall-container.sh -d
To retain your user data so that it is available should you reinstall later, run:

uninstall-container.sh -k
Next steps

Take a guided tour of container by building, running, and publishing a simple web server image.

Project Status

The container project is currently under active development. Its stability, both for consuming the project as a Swift package and the container tool, is only guaranteed within patch versions, such as between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2. Minor version number releases may include breaking changes until we achieve a 1.0.0 release.
