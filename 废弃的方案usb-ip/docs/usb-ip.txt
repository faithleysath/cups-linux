USB support via USB/IP #74
Open
Feature

Description

opened on Jun 10
Being able to interact with devices like controllers, music equipment & IoT devices is important to many developers while using containers. While some container environments have native support for USB passthrough (really only on Linux hosts,) the more common approach is utilizing USB/IP. USB/IP has been in the Linux kernel for years and is used by Windows in WSL2 and Docker Desktop.

I propose enabling the kernel modules and standard USB drivers that'll be useful to most developers.

macOS lacks a complete USB/IP server implementation (I wrote about here) but we do have workarounds in the meantime.

True USB passthrough would be ideal but to my knowledge the underlying virtualization framework does not support it so USB/IP is likely the only option for the time being.

Shouldn't native passthrough be possible through Apple virtualisation framework's USB Devices here, or is this a different use case?

I have limited experience with the VM APIs but I believe that USB support is limited and the primary use case is for mass storage devices. But I could be mistaken.
